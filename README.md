# Deliveroo Data Analysis
## Modules implemented
### 1. Mbox file to CSV file converter
* This module takes in an mbox file as its first parameter and, optionally, a name for the output CSV file.
* Assuming the mbox file only contains Deliveroo delivery confirmation e-mails, it converts the raw data to a CSV file that can be easily analysed later.
* Without a second parameter, the CSV file will take the name of the mbox file.
* An mbox file can be easily obtained from Gmail containing the necessary data through: https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout

## Modules in development
